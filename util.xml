  <Overview>I have started using unraid as a converged data storage and workload environment. The simplicity it provides comes at a cost, which is that I feel the command line interface on the base OS is not well suited to diagnosing problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
An example is that tcpdump is not available, which makes it very difficult for me to diagnose problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
I got around this by creating a container image which slept forever, giving me something to exec into and take actions including running tcpdump.&#xD;
&#xD;
Note: this must be run with Network as Host for tcpdump to run in the host's network context.</Overview>
